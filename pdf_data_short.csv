Rationale
"G 2.1.3 Assessing, sharing and reporting safety-related information is a legal requirement for"
"RUs, IMs and ECMs, as set out in 1.1.2."
G 2.1.4 Network Rail's Plant Manual requires the use of the NIR-Online system.
Guidance
"G 2.1.5 A defect can lead to a fault; a fault can lead to a failure, and a failure can lead to an"
incident. 'Near misses' are considered as incidents which could have been accidents
"in different circumstances. An urgent, high-risk incident is therefore a defect, fault or"
"failure which could have caused an accident, and gives rise to the need for urgent"
action such as a fleet check. Appendix A gives guidance on assessment and reporting
"of defects, faults and failures."
G 2.1.6 RSSB provides several reporting systems:
"a) NIR-Online is used for reporting urgent, high-risk defects, faults and failures on rail"
"vehicles, plant and machinery, as set out in this document;"
"b) Rail Notices is used for reporting urgent operating advice, as set out in"
RIS-3350-TOM;
c) The Safety Management Intelligence System (SMIS) is used for reporting safety-
"related information, as set out in RIS-8047-TOM."
The Standards Catalogue entry for this document on the RSSB website includes
Technical Note TN105; this contains a flowchart to aid the decision process as to
which system or systems to use.
"G 2.1.7 Requirements for reporting defects, faults and failures of Control, Command and"
Signalling Systems are set out in RIS-0707-CCS. RIS-3119-TOM sets out requirements
for investigations of accidents and incidents. RIS-3437-TOM sets out operational
requirements relating to defective on-train equipment.
"G 2.1.8 It is good practice for RUs, IMs, ECMs and other relevant parties to use a dedicated"
"system to monitor safety-related information in order to facilitate assessment,"
sharing and reporting. Such systems could include proprietary Defect (or Failure)
"Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System (DRACAS or FRACAS) software. Use"
of DRACAS is a requirement in RIS-0707-CCS.Rail Industry Standard

"Supersedes RIS-8250-RST Iss 1 with effect from 03/06/2023G 2.1.9 Relevant parties for sharing of details of high-risk defects, faults and failures include"
"other RUs, IMs and ECMs responsible for similar rail vehicles, or those for vehicles with"
"similar components, systems or processes. Examples include:"
a)
"Mechanical components such as wheels, wheelsets, brake discs or pads;"
"b) Vehicle equipment and systems such as doors, brakes, air supply and body-"
"mounted equipment, whether mechanical, electrical, electronic or software-"

c) Common systems such as:
i) Automatic Warning System (AWS);
ii) Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS);
iii) Global System for Mobile Communications - Railway (GSM-R);
iv) European Train Control System (ETCS); and
v) Passenger Information Systems (PIS).
This list is not exhaustive.
G 2.1.10 It is good practice to share issues relating to software configuration and cyber
"security, as these also have the potential to cause an incident. Examples include:"
incorrect or incomplete software updates; unauthorised access to confidential data;
compromised data integrity; denial of availability of data or a system. This does not
relieve an RU or IM of any obligation for reporting under the Network and
Information Systems (NIS) Regulations 2018; see also the Department for
Transport's guidance on Rail Cyber Security.
"G 2.1.11 It is good practice to share details of high-risk defects, faults and failures through user"
"groups, technical committees or other similar means."
2.2 Trends
2.2.1
"Trends in defects, faults and failures on rail vehicles, plant and machinery, and their"
"components, shall be monitored."
"2.2.2 Adverse trends in safety-related defects, faults and failures shall be shared with"
relevant parties.
Rationale
"G 2.2.3 Assessing, sharing and reporting of safety-related information is a legal requirement"
"for RUs, IMs and ECMs, as set out in 1.1.2."
Guidance
"G 2.2.4 It is good practice for RUs, IMs, ECMs and other relevant parties to use a monitoring"
"system for safety-related defects, faults and failures in order to facilitate assessment"
of trends. Such systems could include proprietary DRACAS or FRACAS software. Use of
DRACAS is a requirement in RIS-0707-CCS.

2.3 National Incident Reports (NIRs)
2.3.1
Initiation
"2.3.1.1 When an urgent high-risk defect, fault or failure is identified on a rail vehicle, plant or"
"machinery, or system or component thereof, an NIR shall be initiated using NIR-"
Online.
"2.3.1.2 In the event that the NIR-Online system is unavailable, details of urgent high-risk"
"defects, faults and failures shall be shared by completing and emailing Form 8250 to"
initiate an NIR.
"2.3.1.3 Where the root cause of the urgent high-risk defect, fault or failure is known at the"
"time of generating a first report, an NIR shall be generated with a 'complete' status."
"2.3.1.4 Where the root cause of the urgent high-risk defect, fault or failure is not known:"
a) An initial NIR shall be generated giving the details known to date;
"b) Interim NIRs shall be raised, if necessary, as further details become known; and"
c) A concluding NIR shall be generated when the root cause of the urgent high-risk
"failure, fault or defect has finally been identified."
2.3.1.5 Interim and concluding NIRs shall quote the initial NIR reference number.
Rationale
"G 2.3.1.6 These requirements assist RUs, IMs and ECMs in discharging their legal obligations as"
set out in 1.1.2.
Guidance
"G 2.3.1.7 Users of rail vehicles, plant and machinery can use NIR-Online to communicate"
"urgent high-risk defects, faults or failures for the following:"
"a) Items of mechanical and electrical equipment, including portable or transportable"
infrastructure plant and work equipment;
"b) Plant and work equipment used for, or in association with, the construction,"
"alteration, renovation, repair, maintenance or inspection of railway infrastructure;"
c) Equipment used on stations to move people or materials;
d) Items of equipment associated with the maintenance of rail vehicles and plant
and machinery;
e) Other rail vehicles operating on infrastructure outside the scope of Railway Group
"Standards, for example, in depots;"
f) On-track machines (OTMs) and on-track plant (OTP); andRail Industry Standard

G 2.3.1.8 Form 8250 is available on the Standards Catalogue page of the RSSB website.
G 2.3.1.9 Both the NIR-Online system and Form 8250 are designed to ensure that a level of
detail is captured which will enable affected recipients to develop an action plan.
G 2.3.1.10 It is good practice to generate one or more interim NIRs where investigation into the
"root cause of the defect, fault or failure highlights further important information."
G 2.3.1.11 The timeliness of raising and concluding an NIR is highly dependent on the nature of
"the defect, fault or failure, and the arising action. Table 1 in Appendix A sets out the"
"minimum data used for raising an NIR, which includes 'Remedial action taken'."
"Hence, if a course of action arising from the defect, fault or failure has not been"
"defined, it may not be appropriate to raise an NIR. However, if, for example, a fleet"
"check is considered necessary, it is likely that other RUs, IMs or ECMs would need to"
be alerted; it would then be appropriate to raise an NIR. It is good practice to raise
"immediately any NIR pertaining to cyber security, but this does not relieve an RU or"
IM of any obligation for reporting under the NIS Regulations 2018; see also the
Department for Transport's guidance on Rail Cyber Security..
2.3.2 Receipt
2.3.2.1
"RUs, IMs and ECMs shall acknowledge receipt of an NIR on NIR-Online within"
24 hours of the NIR being issued.
"2.3.2.2 RUs, IMs and ECMs receiving an NIR shall decide whether to initiate any action for"
"similar rail vehicles or vehicles fitted with similar components, systems or subsystems"
under their control.
"2.3.2.3 RUs, IMs and ECMs receiving an NIR shall make their suppliers aware of urgent high-"
"risk defects, faults or failures discovered in items or services of the types they supply,"
and the need for any corrective action by them.
Rationale
"G 2.3.2.4 These requirements assist RUs, IMs and ECMs in discharging their legal obligations as"
set out in 1.1.2.
Guidance
G 2.3.2.5 It is good practice to acknowledge as soon as possible any NIR related to cyber
security.
"G 2.3.2.6 It is good practice for other users of NIR-Online (that is, users who are not RUs, IMs or"
ECMs) to acknowledge receipt of NIRs within 72 hours of issue.
"G 2.3.2.7 When an RU, IM or ECM is aware that a supplier supplies more than one RU, IM or"
"ECM, it is good practice to adopt a collaborative approach. Suppliers in this context"
"can include owners and keepers of rail vehicles, including plant, OTP and OTMs.Management of Safety-Related Rail"

2.3.3.1
"Following receipt of an NIR, RUs, IMs and ECMs shall input to NIR-Online the"
relevance or otherwise of the NIR to their organisation.
"2.3.3.2 Where the NIR is considered relevant, the RU, IM or ECM shall record any actions to"
be taken by themselves or their supplier as a result of receiving the NIR.
"2.3.3.3 Where an RU, IM or ECM has acknowledged an NIR as relevant to their organisation,"
"they shall, in a timely manner:"
a) Close out the NIR; and
b) Record the close-out action taken.
Rationale
"G 2.3.3.4 These requirements assist RUs, IMs and ECMs in discharging their legal obligations as"
set out in 1.1.2.
Guidance
"G 2.3.3.5 An NIR is likely to be relevant to an RU, IM or ECM if they operate or maintain similar"
"railway vehicles, plant or machinery, or those fitted with similar components, systems"
"or subsystems in similar circumstances, or use similar processes, to the organisation"
that initiated the NIR.
G 2.3.3.6 NIRs related to cyber security can have much wider implications.
G 2.3.3.7 Timeliness of NIR closure will depend upon the nature of the NIR and the action
taken. Examples could include:
a) Completion of a fleet check;
b) Completion of a campaign change;
c) Completion of a functional review of software or processes;
d) Incorporation of new inspections in maintenance documentation.
2.3.4 System unavailability
2.3.4.1
"If an RU, IM or ECM determines that the NIR-Online system is unavailable, they shall"
"notify the relevant organisation(s), except where they have already been advised that"
the system is unavailable.
