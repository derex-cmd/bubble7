2.1
Subsystem level requirements
2.1.1 ETCS onboard subsystem: Technical compatibility with ETCS trackside subsystems
2.1.1.1 The ETCS onboard subsystem shall be compliant with the mandatory specifications
"for ETCS Baseline 3 Release 2, including all agreed solutions to error change requests"
compatible with Baseline 3 Release 2. (Normative)
Rationale
G 2.1.1.2 Network technical compatibility: The ETCS comprises the trackside subsystem and
"onboard subsystems, which have to be compatible in order for the system to operate"
correctly.
G 2.1.1.3 Network technical compatibility: An ETCS onboard subsystem that includes all
solutions to error corrections compatible with Baseline 3 Release 2 will be technically
compatible with the trackside subsystem while avoiding hazards associated with
known errors in the specifications.
G 2.1.1.4 Integration with train operations: An ETCS onboard subsystem that is incompatible
with the ETCS trackside subsystem might not be capable of being integrated into the
GB mainline railway.
Guidance
G 2.1.1.5 It is planned to fit the GB mainline railway with the ETCS trackside subsystem against
Baseline 3 Release 2 of the ETCS specifications. ETCS trackside requirements have
been included in the GB Digital Rail generic requirements suite to cater for the current
position where ETCS onboard subsystems do not implement all of the error
corrections. This is an interim state and implementation of the onboard error
corrections will remove this constraint on the trackside application.
G 2.1.1.6 Compliance with the mandatory specifications includes compliance with those
Subset 026 clauses identified in Subset 026 section 9 that 'must be fulfilled by a SRS
compliant ERTMS/ETCS onboard'. Although partial fulfilment is permitted by the CCS
"NTSN, it can lead to technical or operational compatibility issues arising between"
vehicles and the trackside when the vehicle extends its area of use. Future upgrades
to address compatibility issues is likely to be costly to industry and are to be avoided.
"G 2.1.1.7 The Baseline 3 Release 2 specifications are listed in the CCS NTSN, Annex A, Table A"
2.3.
G 2.1.1.8 The ERA technical opinion OPI 2020-2 provides details of error change requests and
"their solutions, and is available on the ERA website. In future, error corrections are not"
"expected to be published in technical opinions, instead the 2023 CCS TSI will be"
proposing a new methodology for publishing error correction solutions.
2.1.2 ETCS onboard subsystem: Impact on rail vehicle route availability

Retrofitting a rail vehicle with an ETCS onboard subsystem shall maintain the existing
route availability of the rail vehicle to which it is fitted. (Normative)ERTMS/ETCS Baseline 3 Onboard

G 
2.1.2.2 Route technical compatibility: So that a rail vehicle fitted with an ETCS onboard
subsystem can still operate on all routes and lines over which it was able to operate
prior to ETCS fitment.
Guidance
"G 2.1.2.3 The route availability of a rail vehicle, determined according to the processes defined"
"in GERT8006, is used for the determination of the compatibility of rail vehicles with"
underline bridges on a route. It is the comparison between the route availability
number of a rail vehicle with the route availability number of an underline bridge at
"the permissible speed of the vehicle, that determines the outcome of a route level"
"assessment of technical compatibility for the vehicle, and may result in restrictions on"
"where the rail vehicle is permitted to operate, and therefore its use, being imposed."
G 2.1.2.4 Meeting this requirement is consistent with the industry agreed objective that fitting
a rail vehicle with the ETCS onboard subsystem will have no adverse impact on rail
"vehicle performance, or the GB mainline railway as a whole."
"G 2.1.2.5 Where rail vehicles can operate on other networks, as well as the GB mainline railway,"
this is considered in the ETCS onboard subsystem design.
2.1.3 ETCS onboard subsystem: Impact on rail vehicle gauge clearance
2.1.3.1
Retrofitting a rail vehicle with an ETCS onboard subsystem shall not adversely affect
the gauge clearance of the rail vehicle to which it is fitted. (Normative)
Rationale
G 2.1.3.2 Route technical compatibility: So that a rail vehicle fitted with an ETCS onboard
subsystem can still operate on all routes and lines over which it was able to operate
prior to ETCS fitment.
Guidance
G 2.1.3.3 The gauge clearance of a rail vehicle imposes restrictions on where it is permitted to
operate and therefore its use. Meeting this requirement is consistent with the industry
agreed objective that fitting a rail vehicle with the ETCS onboard subsystem will have
"no adverse impact on rail vehicle performance, or the GB mainline railway as a whole."
G 2.1.3.4 Adversely affecting existing gauge clearance would be changing the rail vehicle such
that it is no longer compatible with the gauges for which it was cleared prior to the
retrofit being undertaken. Compliance with this requirement does not preclude the
rail vehicle gauge clearance being maintained or improved.
"G 2.1.3.5 Where rail vehicles can operate on other networks, as well as the GB mainline railway,"
this is considered in the ETCS onboard subsystem design.
2.1.4 ETCS onboard subsystem: Impact on rail vehicle maximum design speed

Retrofitting a rail vehicle with an ETCS onboard subsystem shall not adversely affect
the maximum design speed of the rail vehicle. (Normative)Rail Industry Standard

G 
2.1.4.2 Performance: So that a rail vehicle fitted with an ETCS onboard subsystem can still
achieve the same maximum speed as it could prior to ETCS fitment.
Guidance
G 2.1.4.3 Meeting this requirement is consistent with the industry agreed objective that fitting
a rail vehicle with the ETCS onboard subsystem will have no adverse impact on rail
"vehicle performance, or the GB mainline railway as a whole."
"G 2.1.4.4 This requirement is related to the design speed of the rail vehicle, and not to:"
a) The capability for the train driver to amend the maximum train speed as part of
train data entry; or
b) The capability for an authorised person to amend the maximum train speed in
train data configured in the ETCS onboard subsystem; or
c) Any rounding applied when converting the existing mph rail vehicle design speed
"into a km/h value in multiples of 5km/h, and the impact of the ETCS onboard"
supervision to that km/h value when operating in ETCS.
G 2.1.4.5 Compliance with this requirement does not preclude the maximum design speed of
the rail vehicle being increased.
"G 2.1.4.6 Where rail vehicles can operate on other networks, as well as the GB mainline railway,"
the design speed is considered in the ETCS onboard subsystem design.
2.1.5 ETCS onboard subsystem: Impact on rail vehicle braking performance
2.1.5.1
Retrofitting a rail vehicle with an ETCS onboard subsystem shall not adversely affect
the braking capability of the rail vehicle. (Normative)
Rationale
G 2.1.5.2 Route technical compatibility: A rail vehicle fitted with an ETCS onboard subsystem
can be operated on lines where trains are operated using a lineside signalling system.
The braking capability of the rail vehicle affects the stopping distance. Lineside signal
spacing and cautionary aspect sequences affect how much distance (and time) the
train driver has to stop the train at the limit of movement authority (MA).
G 2.1.5.3 Safe integration: This requirement is used to control Hazard OB-H015.
Guidance
G 2.1.5.4 Meeting this requirement is consistent with the industry agreed objective that fitting
a rail vehicle with the ETCS onboard subsystem will have no adverse impact on rail
"vehicle performance, or the GB mainline railway as a whole."
G 2.1.5.5 Compliance with this requirement does not preclude the braking capability of the rail
vehicle being improved.
"G 2.1.5.6 Where rail vehicles can operate on other networks, as well as the GB mainline railway,"
braking capability is considered in the ETCS onboard subsystem design.ERTMS/ETCS Baseline 3 Onboard

Original document supersedes RIS‐0797‐CCS Iss 1 and RIS-0798-CCS Iss 1 with effect from 03/06/20232.1.6 ETCS onboard subsystem: Impact on rail vehicle operating restrictions
2.1.6.1
Retrofitting a rail vehicle with an ETCS onboard subsystem shall not result in any
additional restrictions that would adversely affect operation of the rail vehicle on the
routes where it is currently permitted to be operated. (Normative)
Rationale
G 2.1.6.2 Economic: Introducing additional operating restrictions could adversely affect the
ability of train operators to fulfil their train service provision commitments.
Guidance
G 2.1.6.3 Many existing rail vehicles that operate on the GB mainline railway do not conform to
current standards and were not authorised under current regulations. It is
economically beneficial to achieve ETCS onboard subsystem fitment so that the
conformity assessment needed for authorisation is limited to conformity with the
basic parameters applicable to the ETCS onboard subsystem and its interfaces.
G 2.1.6.4 The term ‘Grandfather rights’ is used to relate to the operation of rolling stock:
a) Built before current regulations or standards were issued; or
b) That do not comply with current regulations or standards; or
c) For which specific derogations have been issued.
G 2.1.6.5 There is benefit in not invalidating the 'Grandfather rights' due to the retrofitment of
the ETCS onboard subsystem.
G 2.1.6.6 Although interoperability authorisations are not required for the existing rolling stock
"subsystem that predates the interoperability regulations, there is still the need for the"
operator of these trains to comply with The Railways and Other Guided Transport
Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 and apply the relevant Common Safety Methods.
The application of a new CCS subsystem will require interoperability authorisation.
G 2.1.6.7 Exemptions from parts of applicable NTSNs that an older vehicle does not need to
comply with may be granted by the Department for Transport (DfT) - see Regulation
14 of the Rail Interoperability Regulations 2011 (as amended).
G 2.1.6.8 The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) can be consulted for guidance on authorisation of
rolling stock designed to earlier standards.
G 2.1.6.9 The supplier can discuss this requirement with the relevant conformity assessment
body before design takes place.
2.1.7 ETCS onboard subsystem: Reliability and availability targets
2.1.7.1
"The ETCS onboard subsystem shall, as a minimum, meet the Mean Time Between"
Service Affecting Failure (MTBSAF) and Mean Time Between Mission Failure
(MTBMF) targets for the onboard subsystem as set out in the ERTMS Reliability
Specification NR/AM/SA/SPE/00147. (Normative)Rail Industry Standard

Original document supersedes RIS‐0797‐CCS Iss 1 and RIS-0798-CCS Iss 1 with effect from 03/06/2023Rationale
G 
2.1.7.2 Reliability & Availability: The MTBSAF and MTBMF achieved by the ETCS onboard
subsystem influences the overall reliability and availability of the ETCS.
G 2.1.7.3 Integration with train operations: An unreliable ETCS onboard subsystem is a
"potential hazard, which would need to be managed as part of the process of safe"
integration of an ETCS fitted rail vehicle into the GB mainline railway.
Guidance
G 2.1.7.4 This requirement contributes to addressing the open point in the CCS NTSN on the
mean time of hours of operation between failures of a CCS on-board subsystem
requiring the isolation of the train protection functions.
"G 2.1.7.5 NR/AM/SA/SPE/00147 sets out reliability and availability targets for the ETCS, which"
are then apportioned to the respective elements of the onboard and trackside
subsystems.
G 2.1.7.6 Meeting the MTBSAF and MTBMF targets specified in NR/AM/SA/SPE/00147 means
that the ETCS onboard subsystem will be at least as reliable as the existing Class B
systems used on the GB mainline railway. Any increase in failures associated with an
ETCS onboard subsystem might result in overall performance losses in conventionally
signalled or ETCS with signals areas.
G 2.1.7.7 NR/AM/SA/SPE/00147 sets out that hours operating in Isolation (IS) are not to be
counted as contributing to the MTBSAF requirements.
G 2.1.7.8 NR/AM/SA/SPE/00147 is called up by the requirements in the GB Digital Rail generic
requirements suite and is published as a supporting document on the SR&I webpage
alongside that suite. The link to the SR&I webpage can be found on the standards
landing page for this RIS on the RSSB's website (www.rssb.co.uk).
2.1.8 ETCS onboard subsystem: Maximum time from No Power (NP) to Standby (SB)
2.1.8.1
The ETCS onboard subsystem shall take no more than 60 seconds to go from NP to
being ready to accept data entry in SB (Status S0). (Normative)
Rationale
G 2.1.8.2 Availability: The time taken to initialise the ETCS onboard subsystem has operational
"implications, for example, it influences how long it takes to make a train ready to"
start a new journey when it reverses at a terminal station.
G 2.1.8.3 Performance: Significantly increasing the time taken to make trains ready to start
could impact on the ability to deliver the train timetable.
Guidance
G 2.1.8.4 The 60 seconds limit includes all of the time needed to undertake any self-test
functions when the ETCS onboard subsystem is operating correctly. It does not
include additional time required for managing failure conditions identified during
self-test functions or due to delays in receiving driver or other train inputs upon which
the start up sequence depends.ERTMS/ETCS Baseline 3 Onboard
