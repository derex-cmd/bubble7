"7.12 Phase 11: Operation, maintenance and performance monitoring  "
7.12.1  Objectives  
"The objective of this life cycle phase is to operate, maintain and support the system under consideration "
such that compliance with RAMS requirements is maintained. This includes continuously monitoring and evaluating the RAMS performance of the system and deriving measures to address shortcomings and to achieve improvem ents.  
7.12.2  Activities  
"Prior to the start of this life cycle phase the manufacturer should provide to the customer all information necessary to formulate plans and procedures for Operation, Maintenance and performance monitoring, and enable compliance with RAMS requirements to be maintained. This information shall include any Safety -related Application Conditions (SRACs) identified during the course of verification and validation.  "
The Operation and Maintenance Plans should include the following:  
1) An explanation  of operational status: The conditions that exist in each system/subsystem/hardware 
should be defined to provide operating and maintenance personnel with sufficient understanding during the following situations:  
BS EN 50126‑1:2017
EN 50126- 1:2017 (E) 
"76 a) start-up: this should describe the start -up conditions of the system, subsystem or hardware when "
"power is initially applied, or following shut -down due to power interruption or other cause;  "
b) normal operation: once the system/subsystem/hardware has successfully completed 
"initialisation, the cond itions during normal operation shall be defined;  "
"c) changeover: if the system/subsystem or hardware in which it is configured, has a facility to "
"change over to either a cold or hot standby system/subsystem, then the conditions defined in a) "
and b) should b e re-stated for this changeover routine. The reaction of the system/subsystem or 
hardware to the changing of failed modules shall also be clearly defined;  
d) shut-down: when a system/subsystem or hardware is shut down intentionally for a configuration 
"change or de- commissioning, or unintentionally via a power failure, then all relevant conditions "
shall be defined.  
2) maintenance should be defined in respect of:  
a) that undertaken on the system in- situ or at designated routine maintenance facilities;  
"b) the repair or refurbishment of systems, subsystems or hardware that are no longer in- situ or that "
"is taking place in facilities not classed as routine maintenance facilities, e.g. mid- life overhauls "
which are undertaken by the customer and the manufacturer;  
c) preventative maintenance;  
d) corrective maintenance;  
"e) maintenance aids: for each level of maintenance, the maintenance aids available to personnel "
should be defined.  
3) an analysis of human factors and competence requirements in maintenance that can inf luence the 
continued achievement of the required RAMS performance.  
4) an analysis of human factors and competence requirements in operation that can influence the continued achievement of the required RAMS performance.  
"The operation and maintenance procedures shall be implemented, particularly with regard to system performance and life cycle cost issues. This requires considering the product, system or process in its operational environment, e.g. including the application of external risk reduction measures  "
"Compliance with RAMS requirements shall be assured throughout this life cycle phase, by:  "
a) regular review and update of operation and maintenance plans and procedures;  
b) conformity with operational plans and procedures;  
c) conformity with maintenance pl ans and procedures;  
d) regular review of system training documentation;  
e) regular review and update (if appropriate) of an operational Hazard Log;  
f) ensuring compliance to the Safety -Related Application Conditions (SRACs);  
g) investigating and handling hazardous incidents and accidents and ensuring rapid response fault finding;  
BS EN 50126‑1:2017
EN 50126- 1:2017 (E) 
77 
" h) for systems undergoing modification, definition and implementation of mitigation actions, if "
"applicable, to ensure the overall integrity of the system until the modification is completed or reported problems are investigated and corrected;  "
"i) conformity with support agreements including logistics, spare parts, repairs, tools, calibration and quality measures to prevent or detect errors occurring during storage and transfer;  "
j) maintenance of the failure reporting and corrective action system (FRACAS).  
NOTE 1  The operational Hazard Log is based on the Hazard Record extracted from the Hazard Log resulting from 
life cycle phase 10.  
The review and updates of the Operation and Maintenance Plan shall include issues raised and addressed during the initial operation and maintenance phase and at applicable stages thereafter.  
It shall be implemented a process for:  
a) the acquisition of RAMS performance data;  
"b) recording of RAMS performance data, associated analysis and evaluation as applicable, e.g. by "
means of a FRACAS . 
Throughout the operational lifetime the system baseline shall be recorded and kept traceable under 
configuration management control.  
NOTE 2  This is of special importance when critical faults are discovered and need to be corrected in more than 
one installation. Manufacturers and maintainers might need to implement complementary arrangements for 
"configuration management, so that the manufacturer can trace the baseline of syste ms provided to particular "
customers and individual maintainers can trace the location of individual items.  
"The FRACAS process is required to continuously provide feedback to the operations safety manager, the "
"designer, manufacturer, operations manager and maintenance manager regarding any failures and "
"defects (and possible causes) found during operational service, Failures will potentially have a variety of causes including component failures, operational errors, maintenance and other errors. It is therefor e "
imperative that the reporting process is clear and logical and that there is a collective forum for all stakeholders to agree the most likely source of failure and hence investigation and corrective actions.  
NOTE 3   
1) Complementary FRACAS records can need to be kept by different entities. Maintenance organisations might 
"have a generic FRACAS which covers many different types of system for which they are responsible, while "
manufacturers can have a FRACAS which encompasses systems supplied to a variety of different customers. 
The manufacturer can be able to diagnose component failures which are not accessible to the maintainer.  
"2) Referencing of accidents, hazards and causes will preferably be consistent within the safety case and other "
performance monitori ng tools and processes. This will help respective organisations to align issues and identify 
trends.  
The FRACAS shall be maintained throughout the operation and maintenance life cycle. To ensure that 
"priority issues are addressed, the failures and defects should be categorised for both safety and reliability for varying levels of severity/criticality. As a minimum, the FRACAS shall be populated with information about failures and defects identified during operation and maintenance. This information shall include:  "
a) time of the failure;  
b) cause of the failure;  
c) detailed description of the failure;  
d) corrective action taken;  
BS EN 50126‑1:2017
EN 50126- 1:2017 (E) 
78 e) safety ranking for the failure.  
f) when and how the failures and defects have been detected (e.g. in operation or during a scheduled 
maintenance);  
g) the effects of the failures and defects up to the railway system level.  
The FRACAS records shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether any improvement is needed in the following:  
h) Operation and maintenance procedures and manuals;  
i) System training documentation;  
j) Operational Hazard Log;  
k) System design;  
l) Human factors aspects of operation and maintenance.  
When changes are proposed an impact analysis shall be performed on each change request. The analysis shall include re viewing the impact on:  
m) the system/subsystem or hardware operational/functional safety performance;  
n) the system/subsystem/hardware interfaces;  
o) adjacent system/subsystem or hardware operational/functional safety performance;  
"p) the modification insta llation work, with consideration given to adjacent system/subsystem and "
hardware that can be affected due to systematic failures.  
"The impact analysis shall result in a decision on which parts of the safety life cycle will be repeated for the modification, all relevant documentation for the effected life cycle steps shall be updated, with equal depth "
"and quality as the original documentation that was produced during the development of the system. The details and results of the modification, risk analysis and testing shall be included in the safety case.  "
All changes and system/subsystem or hardware identified as being at risk shall be tested for correct operation on completion of the change.  
For each identified recommendation a decision shall be taken whether the recommendation shall be realised or not. These decisions shall be justified and recorded.  
7.12.3  Deliverables  
"The results of this life cycle phase shall be documented, including:  "
"a) updated system and support documentation, as appropriate, within this life cy cle phase;  "
